polarDiscretization
####################
Anylisis of solid rocket grain distribution with celllular automata. This approach was incorrect given that the circular meshing did not respect the normal direction of the burning front (as it can be seen in the below picture of the star distribution burning).

Completely new approach due to the incorrect approach of the circular mesh created before.
